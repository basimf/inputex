How to contribute
-----------------

Here are some guidelines to help you help us :

-   Fork the repository on github
-   Please write documentation
-   Write examples
-   Send pull requests from GitHub

Reporting an Issue
------------------

The issues/bugs and feature requests are managed through the [GitHub
issue tracker](http://github.com/neyric/inputex/issues). Feel free to
add new ones, vote for your favorites, comment on existing one, ...

Then don’t get your hopes up. Unless you have a "Code Red, Mission
Critical, The World is Coming to an End" kind of bug, you’re creating
this ticket in the hope that others with the same problem will be able
to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the ticket
automatically will see any activity or that others will jump to fix it.
Creating a ticket like this is mostly to help yourself start on the path
of fixing the problem and for others to confirm it with a "I’m having
this problem too" comment.

Contributing to the Documentation
---------------------------------

This guide represents the biggest documentation effort of the library.
The [API documentation](../api/index.html) is also a huge part of
inputEx's documentation. How can you help ?

-   fix typos, spelling
-   improve code documentation (and therefore the auto-generated API
    documentation)
-   write new examples
-   write about uncovered topics

Contributing to the Code
------------------------

You can contribute in a lot of different ways :

-   Design/Styling - images or css
-   Adapters/backend code
-   core contributions

Translations
------------

The translations are managed on LocaleApp: http://www.localeapp.com/projects/6326
